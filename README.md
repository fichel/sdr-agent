# 🤖 SDR Agent: Your AI-Powered Sales Email Dream Team

Welcome to the future of cold outreach! This isn't just another email automation tool – it's a sophisticated AI agent system with a modern web interface that revolutionizes how you generate personalized sales emails. Think of it as having a whole sales team working 24/7, except they never need coffee breaks and they're powered by cutting-edge AI.

## 🎯 What Does This Thing Actually Do?

Meet your new sales squad:

- **🧠 Sales Manager Agent**: The brains of the operation. This agent coordinates everything and never writes emails directly (because delegation is key!)
- **👔 Professional Sales Rep**: Writes serious, corporate-style emails that mean business
- **😄 Witty Sales Rep**: Crafts engaging, humorous emails that actually get responses 
- **⚡ Concise Sales Rep**: Gets straight to the point – no fluff, all value
- **📧 Email Agent**: The closer. Formats everything perfectly and hits send via SendGrid

The system generates multiple email variations, picks the best one, and sends it out. It's like having a focus group, copywriter, and email marketing specialist all rolled into one.

## ✨ New Features

- **🖥️ Modern Web Interface**: Beautiful Gradio UI replaces the old command-line interface
- **🎯 Dynamic Personalization**: Fully customizable company, signer, and prospect information
- **📊 Real-time Progress**: Watch your AI agents work with live progress indicators
- **🔧 Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables for easy deployment and customization

## 🚀 Quick Start (Because Time is Money)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (because we're living in the future)
- A SendGrid API key (for actually sending those masterpiece emails)
- UV package manager (it's fast, trust us)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
   ```bash

3. **Set up your environment variables:**
   Copy the example environment file and customize it:

   Then edit the `.env` file with your actual API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender@yourcompany.com
   ```

```

- **Sales Reps**: Each has a unique personality and writing style (Professional, Witty, Concise)
- **Email Agent**: Handles subject lines, HTML formatting, and delivery
- **Function Tools**: Custom tools for email sending and formatting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
